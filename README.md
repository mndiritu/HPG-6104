# HPG 6104: Epidemiological Methods II - R Practicals

Welcome to the **HPG 6104: Epidemiological Methods II - R Practicals** repository. This repository is designed to help you apply key epidemiological methods using R as part of the **Master of Public Health Data Science** curriculum.

This repository complements the lecture content and assessments in **HPG 6104**, covering core concepts such as measures of disease frequency, causal inference, confounding, logistic regression, and modern approaches like machine learning in epidemiology.

---

## üìö Course Overview
HPG 6104 focuses on advanced epidemiologic methods, providing learners with the skills to:
- Conceptualize and design observational epidemiologic studies
- Calculate and interpret measures of association between exposures and disease
- Address confounding, selection bias, and information bias
- Apply causal inference frameworks including DAGs
- Test research hypotheses using stratification, standardization, and logistic regression
- Utilize machine learning methods on large health datasets
